if you are visiting this page
you are likely here because 
you are searching for a random sentence
sometimes a random word just is not enough
that is where the random sentence generator comes into play
for writers a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing
since the topic of the sentence is completely unknown
it forces the writer to be creative 
when the sentence appears
there are a number of different ways a writer can use 
the random sentence for creativity
the most common way to use the sentence 
is to begin a story
another option is to include it somewhere 
in the story
a much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story
in any of these cases it forces the writer
